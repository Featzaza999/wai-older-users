## Introduction {#intro}

[Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/) analyzes guidelines, professional articles, and scientific literature on the requirements of people with web accessibility needs related to ageing.

## Who the Literature Review is for {#for}

The Literature Review itself is primarily for researchers and academics.

The outcomes of the Literature Review are also being used to:

- promote accessibility solutions for older web users
- develop resources for users, industry, and others

## What is in the Literature Review {#is}

The Literature Review summarizes:

- literature and statistics about how older adults use the Web
- age-related functional limitations
- requirements of older Web users

The bulk of the Literature Review analyzes:

-   existing literature reviews
-   previous approaches to ‘senior friendly’ web guidelines
-   relationship with WAI guidelines
-   training older adults to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the web
-   studies of older web users’ specific disabilities
-   aspects of web design affecting the elderly
-   involving the elderly in web design and development
-   general usability studies involving elderly people

A finding of the Literature Review is that existing WAI guidelines address many requirements of older web users. Yet, there is little reference to the [WAI guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html) in literature and guidance covering the needs of older Web users.

## Technical report format

The Literature Review follows the W3C format for technical reports that includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status.

## Who developed the WAI-AGE Literature Review

The Literature Review was developed with the [Education and Outreach Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/) (EOWG), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).
