Introduction {#intro}
----------------------

[Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature
Review](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/) analyzes guidelines,
professional articles, and scientific literature on the requirements of
people with Web accessibility needs related to ageing.

The focus of the Literature Review is particularly on Europe, yet it
also includes research outside of Europe and most of the findings apply
internationally.

The Literature Review is a deliverable of the [WAI-AGE
Project](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/); a project that focuses on
education and outreach regarding the requirements of people with Web
accessibility needs related to ageing.

Who the Literature Review is for {#for}
----------------------------------------

The purpose of the Literature Review is to inform education and outreach
to better promote accessibility solutions for older Web users, and
potentially develop profiles or extensions to WAI guidelines.

The Literature Review itself is primarily for researchers and academics.
However, the outcomes from the Literature Review will be used to develop
resources for users, industry, and others.

What is in the Literature Review {#is}
---------------------------------------

[Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature
Review](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-age-literature/) summarizes literature
and statistics about how older adults use the Web, age-related
functional limitations, and requirements of older Web users in the
"Older adults and age-related functional limitations" section. The bulk
of the literature review analyzes:

-   Existing literature reviews
-   Previous approaches to ‘senior friendly’ Web guidelines
-   Relationship with WAI guidelines
-   Training older adults to Use ICT and the Web
-   Studies of older Web users’ specific disabilities
-   Aspects of Web Design affecting the elderly
-   Involving the elderly in Web design and development
-   General usability studies involving elderly people

An initial finding of the Literature Review is that while existing [WAI
guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html) address many
requirements of older Web users, there is little reference to the WAI
guidelines in literature about and guidelines covering the needs of
older Web users.

### Technical report format

The Literature Review follows the W3C format for technical reports that
includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions,
editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the
email address for comments.

Who develops the WAI-AGE Literature Review {#wg}
-------------------------------------------------

The Literature Review is developed under the [Web Accessibility
Initiative: Ageing Education and Harmonisation (WAI-AGE)
Project](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/), supported by the European
Union's 6th Research Framework Programme (FP6). WAI-AGE work is
conducted with the Education and Outreach Working Group
([EOWG](/WAI/EO/)), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium
([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative
([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)).

Invitations to participate in the WAI-AGE project, and to review and
comment on the Literature Review, are announced on the [WAI home
page](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) and [WAI Interest
Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/) mailing list.

Opportunities for contributing to WAI work are introduced in
[Participating in WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/participation).
