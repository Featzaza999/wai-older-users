## Introduction

Older Web users are an increasing market segment and an important target
group for many businesses, governments, and other organizations.

**Web developers, managers, and owners who want to make their websites,
web applications, and web tools usable by older users can use [existing
international accessibility
guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html)** from the World Wide
Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative
([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)).

WAI's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG
2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) materials include guidelines and
techniques for making websites and web applications work better for
people with disabilities as well as older users with accessibility needs
due to ageing. WAI's User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
[UAAG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag) explains how to make web
browsers and media players accessible, which is of particular importance
to older users who have accessibility needs that should be met through
the browser instead of requiring additional [assistive
technologies](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving#at).

## Overlapping Needs

Many older people have age-related impairments that can affect how they
use the Web, such as declining:

-   **vision** - including reduced contrast sensitivity, color
    perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages
-   **physical ability** - including reduced dexterity and fine motor
    control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets
-   **hearing** - including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and
    separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other
    audio, especially when there is background music
-   **cognitive ability** - including reduced short-term memory,
    difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it
    difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks

These issues overlap with the accessibility needs of people with
disabilities. Thus, **websites and tools that are accessible to people
with disabilities are more accessible to older users as well.**

## Introductions and Research

-   [**"Web Accessibility for Older Users" Presentation**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/presentations/ageing/)<br>
    Presents the
    changing worldwide demographics, the prevalence and impact of
    age-related limitations and older people's use of the Web, some
    requirements of older users, and the role of WAI accessibility
    guidelines in meeting these requirements.
-   [**Older Users Online - WAI Guidelines address older users' Web
    experience**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/posts/2009/older-users-online)<br>(Originally
    published in User Experience Magazine, Vol 8, Issue 1, 2009)<br>
    Explains age-related impairments that impact Web use, requirements
    for web design that enhance the ability of older people to use the
    Web, how existing accessibility guidelines for people with
    disabilities cover the needs of older users, and future work in this
    area.
-   [**Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature
    Review**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wai-age-literature)<br>
    Provides detailed research on ageing age-related impairments and Web
    accessibility.

## Resources for Users and Advocates

-   **[Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your
    Computer](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing)**<br>
    Provides guidance for users on how to set your computer to work
    better for your specific needs and preferences so it's easier to use
    websites; for example, enlarging text, making the mouse pointer
    bigger, and using the keyboard instead of the mouse to browse
    websites.
-   [**Contacting Organizations about Inaccessible
    Websites**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/inaccessible)<br>
    Provides guidance on what to do when you come across a website that
    has accessibility barriers that make it hard to use. Explains how to
    identify key contacts, describe the problem, and follow-up as
    needed. Includes sample e-mails.

## Resources for Developers and Managers

-   **[Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Applies](http://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/developing.html)**<br>
    Introduces how to use WCAG 2.0 to improve the accessibility and
    usability of websites and web applications for older people.

### Additional Resources

The resources listed in the previous sections address various aspects
web accessibility related to web users who are older and the overlap
with web users who have disabilities. Additional resources available
through the [WAI website navigation](/WAI/) also touch on this issue,
including:

-   [Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your
    Organization](/WAI/bcase), specifically the sections [Overlap with
    Older Users' Needs](/WAI/bcase/soc.html#older) and [Access for Older
    People](/WAI/bcase/soc.html#of)
-   [How People with Disabilities Use the
    Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web.php), specifically
    the sections on older users
-   [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier
    Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving.html)

## WAI-AGE Project

Web Accessibility Initiative: Ageing Education and Harmonisation
(WAI-AGE) is a European Commission IST Specific Support Action with the
goal of increasing accessibility of the Web for older people as well as
for people with disabilities in European Union Member States. It focuses
on:

-   Better understanding the needs of older web users
-   Participation of older users in W3C standardization
-   Development of educational materials and resources
-   Pursuit of international standards harmonization
