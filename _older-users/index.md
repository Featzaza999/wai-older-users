## Introduction

Older Web users are an increasing market segment and important customer base for many businesses, governments, and other organizations. As we age, it is common to face age-related impairments that affect how we use the web. By [applying international standards and guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html), WAI's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) and WAI's [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag), websites and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities will also work better for older users with accessibility needs due to ageing.

## Overlapping Needs: Older Users and Disabled Users

The needs of older users overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Older users may experience impairment or decline in:

-   **vision** — including reduced contrast sensitivity, color
    perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages
-   **physical ability** — including reduced dexterity and fine motor
    control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets
-   **hearing** — including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and
    separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other
    audio, especially when there is background music
-   **cognitive ability** — including reduced short-term memory,
    difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it
    difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks

These issues overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Thus, websites and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities will also be accessible to older users.


Understanding Older Web Users
-----------------------------

-   [Stories of Web
    Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/stories)
    describes how different users experience the web. An example is
    given (Mr. Yunus) of an 85 year old retiree with reduced vision, a
    hand tremor and mild short-term memory loss who simply cannot use
    the web properly because of poorly designed web pages
-   [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier
    Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving.html)
    describes the benefits of obtaining feedback from actual users
-   [Older Users Online - WAI Guidelines Address Older Users' Web
    experience](https://www.w3.org/WAI/posts/2009/older-users-online)
    (Originally published in User Experience Magazine, Vol 8, Issue
    1, 2009) explains age-related impairments that impact web use,
    requirements for web design that enhance the ability of older people
    to use the Web and how existing accessibility guidelines for people
    with disabilities cover the needs of older users, and future work in
    this area.
-   [Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature
    Review](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/)
    prepared for the WAI-AGE project (which ended on 30 September 2010)
    provides detailed research on aging, age-related impairments and Web
    accessibility.

### Practical Computer Guidance to Help Older Users

-   [Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your
    Computer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing) <br>
    This practical
    resource provides guidance on how to set up your computer to work
    better for your specific needs and preferences; for example,
    enlarging text, making the mouse pointer bigger, and using the
    keyboard (instead of the mouse) to browse websites.

### Technical Resources to Improve Accessibility and Usability for Older Users

The following resources are helpful to those who want or need to make
their websites, web applications, and web tools usable by older users.
For example,

-   [Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
    Applies]({% link _older-users/developing.md %})
    introduces WCAG 2.0 and techniques to improve the accessibility and
    usability of websites and web applications for older people.
-   [Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your
    Organization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/) and [Social Factors
    Developing a Web Accessibility Business
    Case](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html) for your Organization,
    specifically the sections Overlap with Older Users'
    Needs and  Access for Older People are relevant in understanding how
    to introduce accessibility in an Organization.
-   WAI's [User Agent Accessibility
    Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag) provides
    guidance on how to make web browsers and media players accessible to
    older users who have accessibility needs that should be met through
    the browser instead of requiring additional assistive technologies.
