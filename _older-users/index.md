## Introduction

Older Web users are an increasing market segment and important customer base for many businesses, governments, and other organizations. As we age, it is common to face age-related impairments that affect how we use the web. By applying [international standards and guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html) websites and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities will also work better for older users with accessibility needs due to ageing. Such standards are, for example, W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), [Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag) and [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag).

## Overlapping Needs: Older Users and Disabled Users

The needs of older users overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Older users may experience impairment or decline in:

-   **vision** — including reduced contrast sensitivity, color
    perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages
-   **physical ability** — including reduced dexterity and fine motor
    control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets
-   **hearing** — including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and
    separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other
    audio, especially when there is background music
-   **cognitive ability** — including reduced short-term memory,
    difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it
    difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks

These issues overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Thus, websites and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities will also be accessible to older users.

## Statistics and Research

The following statistics and research performed by the WAI-AGE Project in 2010 provides an insight the impact and prevalence of age-related impairments that affect web use.

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

### Ageing and Hearing Loss

#### Impact of hearing loss:

* Audio can be difficult to discern
* Background sounds can be difficult to filter out
* Higher pitch sounds can be missed

#### Prevalence of hearing loss:

* 47% of people 61 to 80 years experience some hearing loss
* 93% of people 81+ years experience some hearing loss

Hearing starts to decline at around 50 years and affects a person's ability to hear higher pitched sounds as well as discern the foreground from background audio such as music or other sounds.  Some hearing loss is experienced by 47% of people 61 to 80 years and 93% of people over 81 years.  Moderate or severe hearing loss or profound deafness is experienced by 20% of people aged 61 - 80 and 75% of people over 80.

### Ageing and Physical Decline

#### **Impact of physical decline:**

Motor skill decline can result from many conditions including arthritis,
essential tremor, and Parkinson's Disease:

-   Difficulty using mouse or keyboard
-   Difficulty with clicking small targets
-   Strain from non-ergonomic tasks

The following figures are from a study carried out by the WAI-AGE
Project in 2010, but are still relevant today.

#### **Prevalence of physical decline:** (Conditions most commonly reported)

-   Arthritis affects at least 50% of people over 65
-   Essential tremor affects up to 20% of people over 65
-   Parkinson's Disease affects approximately 4% of people over 85

Motor skill decline impacts on dexterity and can result from many
conditions, for example arthritis with associated joint stiffening and
reduced fine motor control, and essential tremor or Parkinson's Disease
with associated hand trembling, making mouse use difficult or impossible
for some and also affecting keyboard use. In particular, older people
with physical impairments may have difficulty clicking small links,
selecting radio buttons, and using many fly-out or pull-down menus.

Arthritis is estimated to affect at least 50% of people over 65;
essential tremor (one of many forms of tremor) is estimated to affect up
to 5% of those over 40 and up to 20% of people over 65; and Parkinson's
affects around 4% of those over 85.

### Ageing and Cognitive Decline

#### **Impact of cognitive decline:**

Navigation, comprehension, and task completion can be affected by:

-   Short term memory limitations
-   Difficulty with concentration
-   Distraction from movement or irrelevant material
-   Difficulty coping with information overload

#### **Prevalence of cognitive decline:** (Conditions most commonly reported)

Dementia (UK):

-   1.4% of people 65–69 years
-   24% of people 85+ years

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is more common:

-   Around 20% of people over 70 years are estimated to experience MCI

Cognitive decline is also common, though only dementia and mild
cognitive impairment are commonly reported. While Dementia (including
Alzheimer's disease) is experienced by some older people (1.4% of people
65–69 years increasing to 24% of people over 85 years in the UK), forms
of mild cognitive impairment (or MCI) are much more common, affecting
over 20% of those over 70 years. MCI can result in:

-   Short term memory limitations (which may result in a person
    forgetting the purpose of a website visit if they lose orientation
    on the site)
-   Concentration and distraction issues (consider the volume of
    information on some pages, and the multiple animated advertisements
    that are sometimes present)

Understanding Older Web Users
-----------------------------

-   [Stories of Web
    Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/stories)
    describes how different users experience the web. An example is
    given (Mr. Yunus) of an 85 year old retiree with reduced vision, a
    hand tremor and mild short-term memory loss who simply cannot use
    the web properly because of poorly designed web pages
-   [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier
    Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving.html)
    describes the benefits of obtaining feedback from actual users
-   [Older Users Online - WAI Guidelines Address Older Users' Web
    experience](https://www.w3.org/WAI/posts/2009/older-users-online)
    (Originally published in User Experience Magazine, Vol 8, Issue
    1, 2009) explains age-related impairments that impact web use,
    requirements for web design that enhance the ability of older people
    to use the Web and how existing accessibility guidelines for people
    with disabilities cover the needs of older users, and future work in
    this area.
-   [Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature
    Review](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-wai-age-literature-20080514/)
    prepared for the WAI-AGE project (which ended on 30 September 2010)
    provides detailed research on aging, age-related impairments and Web
    accessibility.

### Practical Computer Guidance to Help Older Users

-   [Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your
    Computer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing) <br>
    This practical
    resource provides guidance on how to set up your computer to work
    better for your specific needs and preferences; for example,
    enlarging text, making the mouse pointer bigger, and using the
    keyboard (instead of the mouse) to browse websites.

### Technical Resources to Improve Accessibility and Usability for Older Users

The following resources are helpful to those who want or need to make
their websites, web applications, and web tools usable by older users.
For example,

-   [Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
    Applies]({% link _older-users/developing.md %})
    introduces WCAG 2.0 and techniques to improve the accessibility and
    usability of websites and web applications for older people.
-   [Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your
    Organization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/) and [Social Factors
    Developing a Web Accessibility Business
    Case](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html) for your Organization,
    specifically the sections Overlap with Older Users'
    Needs and  Access for Older People are relevant in understanding how
    to introduce accessibility in an Organization.
-   WAI's [User Agent Accessibility
    Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag) provides
    guidance on how to make web browsers and media players accessible to
    older users who have accessibility needs that should be met through
    the browser instead of requiring additional assistive technologies.
